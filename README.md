# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-using-LSTMs

"[Named Enity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) is one of the most common [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) problems. The goal is classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\n",

    "Entity tags are encoded using a BIO annotation scheme, where each entity label is prefixed with either B or I letter. B- denotes the beginning and I- inside of an entity. The prefixes are used to detect multiword entities, e.g. sentence:\"World War II\", tags:(B-eve, I-eve, I-eve). All other words, which donâ€™t refer to entities of interest, are labeled with the O tag.\n",
