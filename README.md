[Named Enity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) is one of the most common [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) problems. The goal is classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.,
 
 *What can you use it for?* Here are a few ideas - social media, chatbot, customer support tickets, survey responses, and data mining!
    
  ### Predicting named entities of GMB(Groningen Meaning Bank) corpus,
  
   In this notebook I will perform a [Sequence Tagging with a LSTM-CRF model](https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/sequence-tagging-lstm-crf/) to extract the named entities from the annotated corpus."
    
       
   - **Tip**: *Feel free to try this Notebook with your own data and on your own super awesome named entity recognition task.*,
    
   Now, let's get started! ðŸš€
